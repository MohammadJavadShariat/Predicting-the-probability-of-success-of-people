# Predicting-the-probability-of-success-of-people
Hello!
This program is for you to predict the probability of your success in the future!
In this program, you will be asked eight questions in different fields and you will give a score from 0 to 100 to each of them.
If you enter a letter or a larger or smaller number instead of a number between 0 and 100, you will be warned and the question will be asked again.
After you have answered all eight questions correctly, a total score is made depending on the calculations and mechanism of the program, and depending on whether it is good, excellent or bad, a text score will be shown along with your success percentage in the future.
good luckðŸ‘Œ
